# DreamZero: World Action Models Are Zero-Shot Policies
[[Project Page](https://dreamzero0.github.io/)] [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15922)]

DreamZero is a World Action Model that jointly predicts actions and videos, achieving strong zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. This release package contains everything needed to load a pretrained DreamZero model and run distributed inference via a WebSocket server.

## News

- **02/27:** DreamZero is **#1 on both [MolmoSpaces]([https://huggingface.co/spaces/ai2-adapt/MolmoSpaces](https://molmospaces.allen.ai/leaderboard)) and [RoboArena]([https://robo-arena.github.io/](https://robo-arena.github.io/leaderboard))**! DreamZero-DROID is trained *from scratch* using only the DROID dataset — no pretraining on large-scale robot data, unlike competing VLAs. This demonstrates the strength of video-model backbones for generalist robot policies (VAMs/WAMs).
- **02/27:** Released **DreamZero-AgiBot checkpoint** and **post-training code** for efficient few-shot adaptation. Post-train on just ~30 minutes of play data for your specific robot, and see the robot do basic language following and pick-and-place (see YAM experiments in our paper for more detail).
- **02/20:** Released the **full training codebase, preprocessed dataset, and guide for new embodiments** to replicate the DreamZero-DROID checkpoint and train on your own robot. See [Adding a New Embodiment to DreamZero](docs/DATASET_TO_GEAR_AND_TRAIN.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

## Testing Out DreamZero in Simulation with API
We provide an inference script that directly evaluates a hosted DreamZero-DROID policy on [`sim_evals`](https://github.com/arhanjain/sim-evals). To test out the policy, first request access to the API via this form [link](https://forms.gle/zCj5zjDvHsoeuMXU7). Then, follow these instructions to install [`sim_evals`](https://github.com/arhanjain/sim-evals) and launch evaluation.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/arhanjain/sim-evals.git
cd sim-evals

# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Activate uv environment
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate

# [Optional] update pytorch versions
pip install torch==2.9.1 torchvision==0.24.1 torchaudio==2.9.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129

# Download assets (may need to export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN> first)
uvx hf download owhan/DROID-sim-environments --repo-type dataset --local-dir assets

# Run eval script
cd ..
python eval_utils/run_sim_eval.py --host <API_HOST> --port <API_PORT> 
```

The outputs are saved in `runs` directory.

- **Python**: 3.11
- **Hardware**: Multi-GPU setup (tested on GB200, H100)
  - Minimum: 2 GPUs for distributed inference
- **CUDA**: Compatible GPU with CUDA 12.9+

### Installation

1. **Create conda environment:**
```bash
conda create -n dreamzero python=3.11
conda activate dreamzero
```

2. **Install dependencies (PyTorch 2.8+ with CUDA 12.9+):**
```bash
pip install -e . --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
```

3. **Install flash attention:**
```bash
MAX_JOBS=8 pip install --no-build-isolation flash-attn
```

pip install --no-build-isolation transformer_engine[pytorch]
```

## Downloading Pretrained Checkpoints

### DreamZero-DROID (for inference)

We release a 14B pretrained DROID checkpoint on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-DROID). To download the checkpoint, run

```bash
hf download GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-DROID --repo-type model --local-dir <path/to/checkpoint>
```

### DreamZero-AgiBot (for fine-tuning on new embodiments)

To fine-tune DreamZero on a new embodiment (e.g. YAM, AgiBot), download the pretrained [DreamZero-AgiBot](https://huggingface.co/GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-AgiBot) checkpoint (~45GB) to `./checkpoints/DreamZero-AgiBot`:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-AgiBot ./checkpoints/DreamZero-AgiBot
```

Or with the Hugging Face CLI:

```bash
hf download GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-AgiBot --repo-type model --local-dir ./checkpoints/DreamZero-AgiBot
```

The YAM and AgiBot training scripts use `pretrained_model_path=./checkpoints/DreamZero-AgiBot` by default. See the [new embodiment guide](docs/DATASET_TO_GEAR_AND_TRAIN.md) for usage.

## Running the Inference Server

### Command Overview

The inference server uses PyTorch distributed training utilities to parallelize the model across multiple GPUs:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m torch.distributed.run --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 socket_test_optimized_AR.py --port 5000 --enable-dit-cache --model-path <path/to/checkpoint>
```

To verify the server is working, run a test client. The first few inferences will take a few minutes to warm up. After warming up, inference takes ~0.6s on GB200 and ~3s on H100.

```
python test_client_AR.py --port 5000
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--port`: Port number for the WebSocket server (default: 8000)
- `--model-path`: Path to the pretrained model checkpoint directory
- `--enable-dit-cache`: Enable caching in DiT layers for faster inference (recommended)
- `--max-chunk-size`: Override max_chunk_size for inference (optional)
- `--timeout-seconds`: Server timeout in seconds (default: 50000)
- `--index`: Index for output directory naming (default: 0)


### Output

The server saves:
- **Videos**: Generated video predictions as MP4 files in `{model_path}/real_world_eval_gen_{date}_{index}/{checkpoint_name}/`
- **Input observations**: Saved per message in `{output_dir}/inputs/{msg_index}_{timestamp}/`


## Training

> **Training on a new embodiment?** See [Adding a New Embodiment to DreamZero](docs/DATASET_TO_GEAR_AND_TRAIN.md) for a complete guide on converting your dataset, configuring modalities, and launching training. <em>Make sure to align the 3 camera view order to ensure positive transfer.</em>

### Downloading Pretrained Base Model Weights

DreamZero is built on top of [Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P) and uses the [umt5-xxl](https://huggingface.co/google/umt5-xxl) tokenizer. Download both before training:

```bash
pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"

# You may need to set your HuggingFace token:
# export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>

# Download Wan2.1 model weights (~28GB)
hf download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P --local-dir ./checkpoints/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P

# Download umt5-xxl tokenizer
hf download google/umt5-xxl --local-dir ./checkpoints/umt5-xxl
```

> **Note:** The training script will auto-download these if they are not found at the configured paths, but pre-downloading is recommended to avoid delays at launch.

### DROID Dataset

We release the preprocessed DROID dataset used to train DreamZero on HuggingFace: [GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-DROID-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-DROID-Data).

This dataset is derived from the [DROID 1.0.1](https://droid-dataset.github.io/) dataset with the following modifications:
- Converted from RLDS/TFDS format to [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) v2.0 format
- Idle frames removed using [Physical Intelligence's idle frame detector](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi/blob/main/examples/droid/README_train.md#data-filtering) (`droid_sample_ranges_v1_0_1.json`)
- Episodes without language annotations are filtered out
- Successful episodes only (episodes with non-zero reward)
- 3 camera views: `exterior_image_1_left`, `exterior_image_2_left`, `wrist_image_left`

**To download the preprocessed dataset (~131GB):**

```bash
huggingface-cli download GEAR-Dreams/DreamZero-DROID-Data --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/droid_lerobot
```

If you want to reproduce the dataset conversion from raw DROID 1.0.1 yourself (or modify the filtering), see [docs/DROID_CONVERSION.md](docs/DROID_CONVERSION.md).

### Running Training

```bash
# Configure paths (override defaults as needed)
export DROID_DATA_ROOT="./data/droid_lerobot"
export OUTPUT_DIR="./checkpoints/dreamzero_droid"
export NUM_GPUS=4

# Point to your downloaded model weights (if not using default paths)
export WAN_CKPT_DIR="./checkpoints/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P"
export TOKENIZER_DIR="./checkpoints/umt5-xxl"

# Launch training
bash scripts/train/droid_training.sh
```

### Training Configuration

The training script uses Hydra for configuration and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 2 for distributed training. Key defaults:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
